# Virus Free Web Aplication

This is Virus Free Web Application made with React and Express. It uses VirusTotal API to scan URLs and Files and returns a report with information about these files and if they are malicious or not.

## How to install the project

In the project directory, you should run:

### `npm install`

This installs all the requrired dependencies to make this app run.
You should also get the [https://github.com/elvisdurmishi/file-api](file-api) so the backend of the application can work.

In the file-api project directory you should run:

### `npm install`

Then run:

### `npm start`

So the backend api can run on the background.

Next in the virus-free project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

And open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
